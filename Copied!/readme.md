# Copied! - Clipboard Notification Script

## Description
**Copied!** is a simple PyQt5-based script that monitors your clipboard for changes and displays a notification bubble when new content is copied. This script can be useful when you want to receive visual feedback about the copied content.

## Features
- Monitors clipboard for changes.
- Displays a notification bubble with the text "Copied!" when new content is copied.
- Notification bubble is customizable and has a fade-out animation.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have PyQt5 installed. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install PyQt5
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```
   python copied.py
   ```

3. Once the script is running, copy some text or content to your clipboard.

4. I would suggest turning the py into an exe and adding to your registry :)

5. A notification bubble with the text "Copied!" will appear near your cursor's position to indicate that new content has been copied.
