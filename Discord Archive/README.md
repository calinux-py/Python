Channel Log Discord Bot

This script is a Discord bot developed by CaliNux. It logs channel information and messages from all the servers (guilds) the bot is a member of. The logged data is saved in a text file for later analysis or reference.
Usage

    Install the required dependencies:
        discord library

    Obtain a Discord bot token:
        Create a new bot application on the Discord Developer Portal.
        Under the "Bot" tab, click on "Add Bot" to create a bot for your application.
        Copy the generated token.

    Configure the script:
        Replace the TOKEN variable in the script with your Discord bot token.
        Optionally, update the FILE_PATH variable with the desired file path where the channel information will be saved.

    Run the script:
        Execute the script using a Python interpreter.

    Interact with the bot:
        Once the script is running and the bot is logged in, it will automatically start logging channel information and messages.
        The script will create or append to the file specified in FILE_PATH.
        Each time a channel is logged, the bot will write its name, ID, and messages (if it is a text channel) to the file.
        The bot will log information from all the servers (guilds) it is a member of.

    Stop the bot:
        To stop the bot, terminate the script execution by pressing Ctrl+C in the command line or stopping the Python interpreter.

Important Note

    Make sure to keep your Discord bot token confidential. Do not share it with anyone or include it in public repositories.
    It is recommended to run the script on a server or computer that can maintain a stable connection to Discord servers.
    Depending on the number of servers and channels the bot is a member of, the logging process may take some time and consume system resources.
