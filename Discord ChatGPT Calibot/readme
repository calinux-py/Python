Chat Widget Script

This script implements a chat widget using PyQt5, allowing users to interact with a chatbot powered by OpenAI's language model. The chat widget provides a user interface for entering messages, receiving responses, and customizing the appearance and behavior of the widget.
Dependencies

    PyQt5: The Python binding for the Qt application framework is required to run the chat widget.
    OpenAI: The OpenAI Python library is used to generate responses from the chatbot.

Setup and Configuration

    Ensure that the required dependencies are installed.
    Update the config.txt file located in the config directory with the necessary API keys for OpenAI. If the API keys are not present, an exception will be raised.
    Customize the appearance and behavior of the chat widget as needed by modifying the script.

Usage

    Execute the script in a Python environment.
    The chat widget window will appear on the screen.
    Enter a message in the input text box and press the "Send" button or press Enter to send the message to the chatbot.
    The chatbot will generate a response, which will be displayed in the chat box.
    To clear the chat history, click the "Clear" button.
    The circle button on the left side of the input text box can be used to toggle the window's "always on top" feature.
    The circle button on the right side of the input text box can be used to toggle the size of the chat widget window between two predefined sizes.
    The chat widget window can be moved by clicking and dragging the title bar.

Note: The chat widget's appearance, such as colors and transparency, can be customized by modifying the style variable in the script.
