Email-to-Discord Bot

This script sets up a bot that monitors a specified email account for new emails from a specific sender and posts the content of those emails to a Discord channel. It utilizes the IMAP protocol to connect to the email server and the Discord API to send messages to the Discord channel.
Prerequisites

Before running this script, make sure you have the following:

    Python 3.x installed on your system.
    The required Python packages: imaplib, email, discord, asyncio, discord.ext.
    An email account with the following details:
        Email address: YOUR EMAIL
        App password: YOUR APP PASSWORD
        IMAP server: imap.gmail.com
        IMAP port: 993
        Sender email: RECEIVING EMAIL
    A Discord bot with the following details:
        Bot token: YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKEN
        Discord channel ID: Replace channel number goes here with the actual channel ID.

Usage

    Open the script in a text editor or Python IDE.
    Replace the placeholder values in the script with your actual email and Discord bot details.
    Save the script with a .py extension (e.g., email_to_discord_bot.py).
    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
    Run the script using the command: python email_to_discord_bot.py.
    The bot will log in to Discord and start monitoring the specified email account for new emails.
    Whenever a new email is received, the bot will extract the email content and post it to the specified Discord channel.

Note: Ensure that the Discord bot has the necessary permissions to send messages in the target channel.
Important Considerations

    The script uses an infinite loop to continuously check for new emails. It waits for 5 seconds between each check. You can adjust this delay if needed.
    The script uses the IMAP protocol to connect to the email server securely. Make sure to use the correct IMAP server and port for your email provider.
    The script only processes unseen emails from the specified sender. If an email has been seen before, it will be skipped.
    By default, the script posts the entire email content to Discord. You can optionally extract a specific section of the email content by uncommenting and modifying the relevant code block in the script.
    It's important to handle exceptions appropriately to ensure the script runs smoothly and handles errors gracefully.
