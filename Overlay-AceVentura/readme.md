# Overlay-AceVentura

**Overlay-AceVentura** is a Python script that creates a different kind of overlay ransom on your computer screen. Instead of demanding Bitcoin, it demands you watch Ace Ventura Pet Detective. And boy will whoever runs this script. Because it locks your screen and forces you to while trolling you with messages. In all seriousness, this is a joke demo to demo overlay attacks.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

3. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pyautogui keyboard tkinter
   ```

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python overlay_aceventura.py
   ```

5. Sit back and enjoy the Ace Ventura-themed overlay on your computer screen. You won't be able to close the window or use certain keyboard shortcuts while the overlay is active.

6. After a specified period (approximately 2 minutes), the overlay will automatically close. You could edit it to be longer and include more messages if you want lol.
